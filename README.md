This is the second project for my embedded programming class at ASU. In this project, we are 
utilizing the basics of GPIO and I2C modules, as well as implementing the read/write file
operations in order to transfer data to and from an EEPROM chip.

The full project details can be found in the corresponding instruction PDF that is included
in this initial push.

The pin configuration for the EEPROM are as follows:
1: GND
2: GND
3: 3.3V
4: GND
5: SDA  
6: SCL
7: GND
8: 3.3V
